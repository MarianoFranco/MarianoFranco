### Hi there, I'm Mariano ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end development student at Noroff - School of technology and digital media in Oslo.
I really enjoy creating websites, especially the effects and functionality part. For this I use HTML, CSS and JS. I am currently trying to learn as much as possible about JavaScript and will soon delve into frameworks, more specifically in React JS.
Here you can find some of my projects.
